#AI CW README

In order to run the code, please head over to SelectionHyperHeuristic class. In that file, you will find a main function which allows you to run all sorts of tests.
All the file paths and file names of the test instances have been stored as an array. A CWRunner object has been created as well, which takes int trials, int steps, int runTime, int numOfSubsetsRemoved, String filePath, String fileName,
Double IOM, Double DOS, Double Pc, and Double T as arguments. Then you can call the singlePointSearch function, which will execute the entire program for you when the CWRunner object have been passed in.
